      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am a graduate of vocational high school with a strong background in
        various non-IT fields, including administration, export & import,
        logistics, and warehousing. Since 2020, I became intrigued by the world
        of programming and made a commitment to deepen my knowledge in this
        field. I took a significant step by enrolling in a MERN fullstack web
        programming bootcamp from late 2022 to early 2023.
